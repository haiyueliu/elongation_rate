# RNA_elongation_rate

This repository contains the main script to calculate the absolute RNA Pol II elongation rates for individule genes based on DRB/TTchem-seq2 data.
[DRB/TTchem-seq2]() is an updated version of DRB/TTchem-seq [Gregersen et al., 2020](DOI: 10.1038/s41596-019-0262-3) data. It differs from DRB/TTchem-seq in two main manners:

1. The DRB release times have been reduce from 10, 20, 30 and 40 minutes to 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes.
2. In stead of calling the peaks of elongation waves, the wave fronts have been called and represent the distance travelled by RNAPII.

We have shown that we increased the number of estimation for individual genes by ~8 fold comparing to DRB/TTchem-seq. The R scripts for calculating the gene-specific transcription elongation rates are shown below.
